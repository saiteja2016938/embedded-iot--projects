Greenhouse Environment Monitoring & Control System ðŸŒ±

Overview
This project is designed to monitor and control key environmental parameters inside a greenhouse using sensors and automation. It helps maintain optimal conditions for plant growth by tracking temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levelsâ€”and automatically controlling fans, lights, and irrigation.
The system was not only built and tested but also "presented at a college expo" and "validated through real-world feedback from greenhouse farmers".



 Components Used

- Arduino UNO  
- DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- LDR Module (Light Detection)  
- Relay Module (for fan and light control)  
- LCD Display (16Ã—2)  
- Mini Fan & Light  
- Li-ion Battery with protection circuit  


 College Expo Presentation (Image 2)

At the college project expo, the system was showcased to faculty, peers, and visitors. The setup included:

- A working demo of the sensors reacting to environmental changes  
- Real-time data displayed on the LCD  
- Automatic fan activation when temperature crossed a threshold  
- Soil moisture triggering irrigation logic  
- Light control based on ambient brightness  

Feedback Highlights:
- Appreciated for its simplicity and practical use in agriculture  
- Suggestions to add mobile app control and data logging  
- Recognized as a scalable solution for small-scale farmers  


 Real Farm Visit & Feedback (Image 3)

After the expo, the project was taken to actual greenhouse farms. You interacted with farmers and explained how the system works. The visit helped uncover real challenges like:

- Uneven soil moisture across different beds  
- Manual irrigation delays during peak heat  
- Lack of awareness about affordable automation options  

Farmer Feedback:
- Liked the idea of automatic fan and irrigation control  
- Requested solar-powered options for remote farms  
- Suggested adding SMS alerts for critical conditions  

This visit validated the projectâ€™s relevance and inspired future upgrades like solar integration, mobile alerts, and multi-zone control.



 Applications

- Greenhouse automation for small and medium farms  
- Smart irrigation and climate control  
- Educational tool for agri-tech learning  
- Scalable for polyhouses and vertical farming setups

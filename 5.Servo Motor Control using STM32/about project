 Servo Motor Control using STM32

 Overview

This project shows how to control a hobby servo motor with an STM32 Nucleo board. By outputting a simple PWM signal from one of the MCU’s timers, we can set the servo shaft to any angle between 0° and 180°.


Hardware Used

- STM32 Nucleo board (e.g., G070RB or F103 “Blue Pill”)  
- SG90 5 V hobby servo  
- 5 V power supply (separate or via regulator)  
- Jumper wires and small breadboard  
- Common ground connection  



 Working Principle

- The STM32 timer is set up to generate a 50 Hz PWM signal (20 ms period).  
- A pulse width of 1 ms moves the servo to 0°, while 2 ms moves it to 180°.  
- Any pulse between 1 ms and 2 ms sets intermediate angles.  
- In the main program loop, we change the pulse width to sweep the servo back and forth.  


 How to Use

1. Wire the servo control pin to the STM32 PWM output (e.g., PA6).  
2. Connect servo VCC to 5 V and servo GND to MCU GND.  
3. Upload your firmware that:
   - Initializes the timer for PWM
   - Maps desired angles to pulse widths
   - Updates the compare register in a loop  
4. Power on the board and watch the servo sweep smoothly.

 Applications & Next Steps

- Basic robotics arm joint control  
- Pan/tilt camera mounts  
- Automated door locks or grippers  
- Extend by adding feedback with a potentiometer for closed-loop control

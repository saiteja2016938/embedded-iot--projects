IoT-Based Health Monitoring and Automation System
 Overview

The IoT-Based Health Monitoring and Automation System integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology with healthcare and home automation. It continuously monitors patient health and automates appliances like fans and lights based on real-time sensor data and voice commands.

 Abstract

The IoT-Based Health Monitoring and Automation System is an innovative project designed to integrate advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technology into healthcare and home automation, offering real-time monitoring, seamless connectivity, and automated control.

The system uses Arduino Uno and ESP8266 NodeMCU, along with ECG, IR, and DHT11 sensors. Actuators such as relay modules, DC motors, and buzzers ensure effective automation and alert mechanisms. Using Arduino IoT Cloud, users can monitor and control devices remotely.

It tracks heart rate, temperature, and patient presence with real-time LCD display and audible alerts. The system also provides voice-based control using Google Assistant, automating fan and light operation based on environmental conditions.

With scalability and modularity, the design supports future upgrades like SpO₂ monitoring, solar power integration, and mobile app interfaces, bridging healthcare and smart home technologies to improve patient safety and quality of care.

 Working Principle

Health Monitoring:

ECG sensor measures heart rate.

DHT11 tracks body temperature.

IR sensor detects patient’s presence.

LCD displays all data in real time.

If abnormal values occur, buzzer sounds and data updates to cloud.

Automation System:

Relay module controls fan and light.

Temperature data automates fan operation.

LDR or IR-based control automates lighting.

Google Assistant enables voice commands for manual override.

IoT Cloud Integration:

ESP8266 sends sensor data to Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.

Dashboard accessible via phone or web browser for caregivers.

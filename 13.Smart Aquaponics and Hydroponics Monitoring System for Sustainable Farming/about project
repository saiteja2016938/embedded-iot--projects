Smart Aquaponics and Hydroponics Monitoring System for Sustainable Farming

Project Overview:
The Smart Aquaponics and Hydroponics Monitoring System integrates IoT technology into modern farming to create a closed-loop ecosystem that supports sustainable food production. By combining fish cultivation (aquaponics) and soil-less plant growth (hydroponics), this project enables efficient water usage, automation, and real-time monitoring — ideal for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract:
In the face of increasing global water and food scarcity, aquaponics and hydroponics offer a sustainable farming model by integrating fish cultivation and plant growth within a closed-loop system. This project proposes an intelligent aquaponics setup using a PVC flask connected to a fish tank via dual pipes for continuous water circulation. Nutrient-rich fish wastewater is supplied to plants, promoting healthy growth while naturally purifying the water for the fish.

A soil moisture sensor and water pump maintain optimal water levels, while a DS18B20 temperature sensor monitors tank temperature. An LDR-based lighting system ensures adequate photosynthesis under low-light conditions, and a DHT11 sensor with fan control regulates ambient temperature. The ESP32 microcontroller coordinates all actions and transmits real-time data to the cloud.

The system demonstrates an eco-friendly farming technique that conserves up to 90% more water than traditional methods while boosting yield by up to 50%. Future enhancements include automated pH monitoring, adaptive LED lighting, and mobile app-based control.

Components Used:
ESP32 Microcontroller – Controls and connects sensors to cloud
DS18B20 Temperature Sensor – Monitors water temperature
DHT11 Sensor – Monitors ambient temperature and humidity
Soil Moisture Sensor – Maintains proper water levels
LDR Sensor – Detects light intensity for plant growth
Water Pump (via Relay) – Circulates nutrient-rich water
Fan (DC Motor) – Regulates temperature inside setup
PVC Pipes & Fish Tank – Supports water flow between fish and plants
LED Grow Lights – Provides photosynthetic light when needed

Working Principle:

Fish Waste Recycling – Fish excreta contains ammonia-rich nutrients. This nutrient-rich water is pumped to the plant bed.

Plant Filtration – Plant roots absorb nutrients, purifying the water naturally. The clean water returns to the fish tank forming a closed loop.

Automation – The ESP32 automates pump, fan, and light control using sensor feedback. Water and temperature thresholds are pre-programmed for efficiency.

IoT Integration – Real-time data (temperature, light, moisture) is sent to the cloud dashboard. Users can remotely monitor and control the setup via the IoT platform.

IoT Features:

Cloud connectivity for real-time monitoring

Dashboard displaying temperature, humidity, and light intensity

Remote control of fan and pump

Alerts for critical environmental changes

Data logging for analysis and optimization

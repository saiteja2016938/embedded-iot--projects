 Wearable Health Monitoring & Fall Detection System

Overview  
This wearable device monitors human pulse rate and detects falls using onboard sensors. It’s powered by a rechargeable Li-ion battery that charges continuously using body heat and sunlight, thanks to a thermoelectric converter and solar panel. The system is built around MAX30100 for pulse sensing and MPU6050 for motion detection, making it ideal for health tracking and safety applications.



 Components Used

- MAX30100 pulse rate sensor  
- MPU6050 accelerometer + gyroscope (for fall detection)  
- Arduino Nano (or similar microcontroller)  
- Buck converter (for voltage regulation)  
- Li-ion battery (e.g., 3.7 V 2600 mAh)  
- Battery protection circuit  
- Thermoelectric generator (temperature-to-electricity converter)  
- Small solar panel  
- Jumper wires and breadboard  



 Working Principle

1. Pulse Monitoring  
   - MAX30100 reads heart rate and SpO₂ levels.  
   - Data is processed and optionally displayed or transmitted.  

2. Fall Detection  
   - MPU6050 tracks sudden changes in acceleration and orientation.  
   - If a sharp drop or tilt is detected beyond a threshold, it flags a fall event.  

3. Power Management
   - Buck converter steps down voltage from solar panel or thermoelectric source.  
   - Battery protection circuit prevents overcharging and deep discharge.  
   - Device charges passively from body heat and ambient light while worn.  


 Code Summary

- Initialize I2C for both MAX30100 and MPU6050  
- Read pulse and SpO₂ data every second  
- Continuously monitor acceleration and angular velocity  
- If fall condition is met ( sudden drop + tilt), trigger alert  
- Optional: send data via serial or Bluetooth for logging  

cpp
// Pseudocode
if (mpu.detectFall()) {
  triggerAlert();
}

pulse = max30100.readPulse();
spo2  = max30100.readSpO2();

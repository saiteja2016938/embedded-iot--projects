Overview :
This project demonstrates a sound-activated clap switch using a 555 Timer IC in monostable mode.
When a clap is detected, the circuit activates an LED and buzzer for a short duration and then automatically switches them OFF.


🛠️Hardware Used :

555 Timer IC
Electret Microphone
NPN Transistor (BC547)
Resistors and Capacitors (timing & biasing)
LED 
Buzzer 
9V Battery
Breadboard and jumper wires


⚙️ Working Principle
The microphone captures clap sound and converts it into a small electrical signal.
The transistor amplifier boosts the signal.
This amplified signal triggers the 555 Timer (configured in monostable mode).
The output pin (Pin 3) of the 555 goes HIGH for a fixed time, powering the LED and buzzer.
After the set time interval, the output returns LOW, switching OFF both components.

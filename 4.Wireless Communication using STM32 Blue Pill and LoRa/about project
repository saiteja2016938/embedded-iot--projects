Wireless Communication using STM32 Blue Pill and LoRa

 Overview

This project showcases bidirectional, long-range wireless communication between two STM32 “Blue Pill” development boards using SX1278 LoRa modules.
One Blue Pill acts as a transmitter, sending text packets or sensor data, while the other serves as a receiver and can acknowledge messages or toggle an LED based on the content.


 Hardware Used

- STM32 “Blue Pill” development board × 2  
- SX1278 LoRa Transmitter & Receiver modules × 2 (433 MHz)  
- USB-to-Micro USB cables for programming and power  
- Status LEDs and current-limiting resistors  
- Push-button (on transmitter)  
- Breadboards and jumper wires  
- 3.3 V regulated power supply or Li-Po battery  


 Working Principle

1. Initialize SPI on each Blue Pill to interface with its SX1278 LoRa module.  
2. The transmitter Blue Pill reads a push-button input or sensor value and formats a payload string (e.g., “PING” or sensor reading).  
3. Using the LoRa library, the transmitter sends the payload over 433 MHz.  
4. The receiver’s LoRa module captures incoming packets and delivers them via SPI to the second Blue Pill.  
5. The receiver parses the payload: if it reads “PING,” it toggles an LED and sends back “PONG.” Otherwise, it displays or logs the received data over the serial port.  
6. The transmitter listens for the acknowledgment packet and indicates success with its own LED blink.  


 Transmitter Code Summary

- Configure SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, SCK) and NSS for SX1278.  
- Initialize the push-button GPIO and status LED GPIO.  
- In `setup()`, begin LoRa module at 433 MHz and set transmission power.  
- On button press, build a packet (`LoRa.beginPacket(); LoRa.print("PING"); LoRa.endPacket();`).  
- After sending, switch LoRa to receive mode and wait for acknowledgment.  
- Blink LED once on successful “PONG” receipt.  


 Receiver Code Summary

- Initialize SPI and LoRa at matching frequency and settings.  
- Initialize status LED GPIO.  
- In the main loop, call `LoRa.parsePacket()` to check for new data.  
- On packet arrival, read the buffer into a string.  
- If the string equals “PING,” toggle LED and reply with “PONG.”  
- Otherwise, output the received string to the serial console and blink LED twice.  


Applications

- Remote control and telemetry for robotics or sensor networks  
- Point-to-point text messaging over kilometers without internet  
- Outdoor data logging in agriculture or wildlife tracking  
- Rapid prototyping of long-range IoT links
